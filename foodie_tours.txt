Title: A Symphony of Flavors in Sunny Shimla

As the morning sun peeks over the majestic Himalayan range, illuminating the charming hill station of Shimla, the city softly stirs awake. The day's forecast predicts a warm and welcoming 28°C, perfect for an outdoor foodie adventure across the city. 

Begin your day with a hearty breakfast at the Patio Terrasse of Hotel Willow Banks, one of the city's architectural gems from the British Raj era. Under a sky painted with hues of pink and orange, enjoy Sidu - a local delicacy of fermented and steamed wheat bread stuffed with ghee and poppy seeds. As you break open the crusty exterior, releasing a warm waft of earthy and sweet aroma, allow your taste buds to dance with the different flavors. Interesting fact: Sidu is traditionally made during winter months to provide locals with much-needed energy and warmth.

As you savor your breakfast, take in the panoramic views of Shimla's landscape, etched with deep green forests, glimmering rivers, and bustling city life.

Post breakfast, explore Shimla’s bustling bazaars, stroll down the nostalgic British lanes dotted with quaint cottages, or if you're up for it, a hike to the Jakhu temple, dedicated to the monkey god, Lord Hanuman.

As afternoon descends upon the city, we recommend lunch at the renowned Goofa Ashiana. Just in time for their specialty, Chha Gosht. This slow-cooked delight, made from marinated lamb in a tangy yoghurt and gram flour curry with a concoction of Himachali spices, is rich in flavor. To add to your experience, the restaurant offers outdoor dining, where you can indulge in your meal amidst the enchanting views of the Shimla valley. 

You may not know, but Chha Gosht is usually prepared during special occasions or festive seasons because of its lengthy and meticulous preparation process.

As the evening paints the sky with a spectrum of warm hues, it's time to immerse in the delicious world of Himachali street food. Head over to the buzzing Lower Bazaar, where amidst the symphony of chatters and haggling, you'll find stalls serving Babru, a local variation of the classic North Indian Kachori.

Crafted with black gram dal stuffed in kneaded dough and deep-fried, Babru is loved by the locals as an evening snack. Find a spot under the starlit sky and delve into the beautiful chemistry of crisp Babru paired with tangy tamarind chutney. Let the flavours play hide and seek on your palate leaving a trace of fond memories from Shimla's culinary landscape as the day gently tucks itself in.

Today's journey across Shimla’s cuisine has been more than satiating. These iconic dishes weaved tales of rituals, festivals, and the city's ever-lasting love for food, marking an unforgettable experience in this pleasant and warm weather.

As the moon adorns the Shimla sky, retire to your hotel, with a heart full of flavours, aromas, and a promise to return to this stunning city once again.
